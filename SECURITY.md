# Reporting a Vulnerability
We value security for the project very highly. We encourage all users to report any vulnerabilities they discover to us. If you find a security vulnerability in the project, please report it responsibly by sending an email to nico.mak@0x101-cyber-security.de

Reporting a critical vulnerability will be recognized with a certificate for your résumé and rewarded with a lifetime membership (limited to 50 devices).
