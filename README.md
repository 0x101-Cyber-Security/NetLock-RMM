## üê≥ Docker Installation (Quick Setup)

Do you wish to get started as fast as possible? Our docker compose script ensures an easy and smooth setup, currently supporting three deployment scenarios:
- Single IP / VPS / Bare Metal, basically a machine & ip only for SCNCore Plus
- Reverse Proxy (supports any reverse proxy)
- Local Testing (only for local test environments, not for production)

The script expects docker compose to be installed, on a linux distribution. Best to use would be Ubuntu 24.04. The script deploys the SCNCore Plus components as well as a MySQL 8.0 server and connects everything with each other.

### Steps:
1. **Download the script with wget:**
   ```bash
   sudo wget -P /home https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmetkarakayaoffical/SCNCORE-PLUS/main/docker-compose-quick-setup.sh
