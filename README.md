## Features? We have plenty of them. Here is a small preview

The Web Console and server software come as a standalone server based on Kestrel, eliminating the need to configure and maintain complex server software such as Apache. Do you like Let's Encrypt? The Let's Encrypt integration by LettuceEncrypt offers an easy way to protect your connection with SSL. Our security concept offers high flexibility with server roles, meaning you could run all server components on one machine or split them into different roles. You can also define fallback servers for each role.

- Multi platform. The agent supports windows, linux & macos. (x64 & arm64) 
- Multi-tenancy, including locations and group management
- One-click agent installer for all platforms
- Real-time remote shell, file browser, task manager & service manager
- Remote control & support your users. It's as easy to use as TeamViewer. ;)
- File server. Host your favourite tools directly with NetLock RMM and embed them directly into your scripting.
- Event notifications (email, Microsoft Teams, ntfy.sh, and Telegram)
- Software & hardware inventory
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus Management
- Policy Management (define policies that will be applied to your devices. Example: Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings and notifications, sensors, and jobs)
- Dashboard (statistics and unread events)
- Events (browsing through events, filtered by severity and more)
