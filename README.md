# Setup NetLock RMM using Docker in 10 minutes
[See in our documentation](https://docs.netlockrmm.com/en/server-installation-docker)

Do you wish to get started as fast as possible? Our docker compose script ensures a easy and smooth setup, currently supporting three deployment scenarios:
- Single IP / VPS / Bare Metal, basically a machine & ip only for NetLock RMM
- Reverse Proxy (supports any reverse proxy)
- Local Testing (only for local test environments, not for production)

The script expects docker compose to be installed, on a linux disctribution. Best to use would be Ubuntu 24.04. The script deploys the NetLock RMM componments as well as a MySQL 8.0 server and connects everything with each other.

1. Download the script with wget.
```plaintext
sudo wget -P /home https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x101-Cyber-Security/NetLock-RMM/main/docker-compose-quick-setup.sh
```

2. Make it executable:
```plaintext
sudo chmod +x /home/docker-compose-quick-setup.sh
```

3. Execute it:
```plaintext
sudo ./home/docker-compose-quick-setup.sh
```

4. Follow the instructions.
